# ProjectWindowName

## Installation

To install, download the project from Github, open and build `ProjectWindowName.xcodeproj`. The plugin is built directly into your user's Xcode plugin directory `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. Quit and relaunch Xcode to use.

Alternately, you can install using `Alcatraz`.

## Requirements

ProjectWindowName has been tested with Xcode (5.1.1, 6.0, 6.1) on OS X 10.9.x.

## Usage

`ProjectWindowName` has no user interface, it changes Project / Workspace window title to include the Project name. e.g. "<Project name> - <File name>".
